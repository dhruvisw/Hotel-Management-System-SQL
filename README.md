ðŸš©This project is our attempt to create a database management system for hotel management. We were able to create a database management system for managing the operations of the hotel such as keeping the information regarding various hotel chains, the respective staff which work throughout these hotel chains, the information about guests, description of rooms, etc. Overall, the database management system is quite beneficial in managing such large and varied number of operations and its data.
